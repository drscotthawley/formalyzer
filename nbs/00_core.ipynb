       "'  Dear Graduate Admissions Committee,  It is with absolute confidence that I strongly recommend Brody Blackwood for admission to your program. He is extremely well-suited for graduate work and ranks within the top 2% of students I have worked with in my 19 years of undergraduate teaching.  It has been my great pleasure to work with Brody as a one-on-one research supervisor, as well as an instructor in two “upper-level physics” courses: “PHY3110 – Analytical Mechanics,” “PHY4410 – Survey of Advanced Physics” and “PHY4420 – Deep Learning and AI Ethics.”   He is a rare student who excels in everything he does. His work in my courses was excellent, and in his research, he has been conscientious and motivated.  He is easy-going, gets along well with other students, and works well either individually or in team settings.  Quite simply, Brody works: he is one of the rare students who does what you tell him to do, on time, and does it very well. His homework was always fully complete, well-written and fully correct.  In his independent study work, often we would meet more frequently than the typical once-a-week schedule that I have had with other students because Brody would already have finished the work I had given him, and this allowed us to move much more quickly than with many other students I have supervised in the past.  He is capable of figuring things out for himself but is also not averse to asking questions if he wants to understand a topic better.  In these respects, he already exhibits the properties of an excellent graduate student, and I expect this to continue in the future.  I have every confidence that he will make an excellent student in graduate course work, an excellent research team member, and a great addition to your program.  Please feel free to contact me should you have any questions.     Sincerely, \\n Scott H. Hawley, Ph.D. Professor of Physics  \\n          DEPARTMENT of  CHEMISTRY & PHYSICS,  COLLEGE OF SCIENCES AND MATHEMATICS \\n1900 Belmont Boulevard Nashville, TN 37212-3757  phone  615-460-6421 fax  615-460-5458 '"

    "0:14\n",
    "What's been happening? Plenty of stuff. Um I've got the um the\n",
    "0:20\n",
    "showcase this time around. I um had a plethora of options to choose from. So\n",
    "0:25\n",
    "I'm going to feature a few. Just let me hit record and then say that sentence again. All right.\n",
    "0:34\n",
    "Hey, Jono. What's been happening? Lots of good stuff on the um Share It\n",
    "0:40\n",
    "channel. Um all of these should be fairly recent if you're watching this as it comes out. Um but I'll also try and\n",
    "0:46\n",
    "collect the links that I shared. Um so the first one was from um Ta a student\n",
    "0:51\n",
    "recreating some user interface pieces a lovely sidebar and some drop downs with\n",
    "0:57\n",
    "the um base camp user interface library I believe um kind of a clone of the\n",
    "1:04\n",
    "famous shed CN library but it nicely it's kind of very vanilla JavaScript\n",
    "1:10\n",
    "vanilla CSS and so it works well with fast HTML. Yeah. Um, and they were kind enough to\n",
    "1:17\n",
    "share their dialogue as well as the demo. And you can see over the course of the dialogue, they build up all the pieces. And then right at the end, this\n",
    "1:22\n",
    "is that page we were just looking at. You've got the sidebar and the main with the toggle button, the drop down. Um, so\n",
    "1:30\n",
    "yeah, cool to see the kind of progressive building up of a library um in a dialogue. Um, very nice to see\n",
    "1:35\n",
    "that. Thanks, TA. Nice. Um then another one I wanted to feature was um something that is going\n",
    "1:42\n",
    "to be useful in relation to maybe two lessons from now, lesson nine um when\n",
    "1:48\n",
    "we'll look at reading and writing a little bit. Um this was one shared by Frank from PDS to navigable knowledge.\n",
    "1:55\n",
    "Um, and so this is one of those things where there's many different ways to tackle it, but um, this was a beautiful, clean implementation going from a PDF,\n",
    "2:02\n",
    "um, turning that into images and then using a model that's been trained for character recognition to then pass those\n",
    "2:08\n",
    "images into nicely structured text. Um, and so they work through the steps piece by piece, very much like inspecting\n",
    "2:14\n",
    "what's coming out, finding issues, um, improving it, working on these different\n",
    "2:19\n",
    "steps. Um, and so I got kind of curious about the library of like, oh, what is this? Um, missed OCR library. I haven't\n",
    "2:26\n",
    "heard of it before. Um, and then, oh, it's got a nice docs page. Wait a minute. This looks somewhat\n",
    "2:31\n",
    "familiar if you were there for our MVDE lesson. Like, this looks like an MBDEV project. And sure enough, it's actually\n",
    "2:37\n",
    "um Frank himself um has his um library that's built up in MBDE um and dialogues\n",
    "2:44\n",
    "with small pieces that then demonstrate their functionality. Um, so you can go and check out the GitHub repository for\n",
    "2:49\n",
    "the code as well. Um, yeah. So I thought that was an amazing example of somebody developing something that they clearly\n",
    "2:56\n",
    "wanted and then sharing a dialogue showing, you know, how to use it and why it's good and and just a very nice\n",
    "3:02\n",
    "positive. Um, sorry, Jonno, can you just maybe open a link to the base coat website because folks in the chat are wondering what we\n",
    "3:08\n",
    "were saying when we said base coat. So they see it. Right. There it is. Base code UI.\n",
    "3:13\n",
    "Yeah. Yeah. And so you'll notice the nice um sidebar is um I think the first\n",
    "3:19\n",
    "piece that TA was working on. And then there's lots of other components and things still to be added. So um yeah,\n",
    "3:25\n",
    "and all of the dialogues you're showing here are all available in the Discord, but maybe we'll collect these particular\n",
    "3:31\n",
    "ones in the YouTube notes so people can see these for sure. Um okay, I had a couple more\n",
    "3:39\n",
    "final demos. Cool. This was one um Andreas shared doing WebGL animations. And so they're\n",
    "3:47\n",
    "writing um code to create little um I guess you'd call it generative\n",
    "3:53\n",
    "programming, but not like generative AI, just generative in the um old school sense. Um but it was nice. They sort of\n",
    "3:59\n",
    "worked through like what are the pieces to preview an HTML canvas? Are there some pieces that they can do to like\n",
    "4:05\n",
    "wrap up the setup? With WebGL, you often need like, okay, I need to create the canvas and create a shader and a vertic\n",
    "4:12\n",
    "shader. Yeah. Yeah. I know it's it's often easy to get bogged down. Um, so it's cool to see them building up the pieces. It's still\n",
    "4:19\n",
    "um, you know, obviously like the developer experience of writing JavaScript in a string. You know, we could maybe figure out ways to try and\n",
    "4:25\n",
    "improve that. But I was just really impressed to see like, yeah, the step by step. Can I draw a line? Okay. What can\n",
    "4:31\n",
    "I refresh my animation? Okay. Okay, what if I want to, you know, just like really building up with this inline preview. It\n",
    "4:37\n",
    "felt like a tutorial on WebGL. Um, so yeah, really enjoyed that. Um, and then\n",
    "4:42\n",
    "I don't know, Jeremy, can I feature my my own demo of a use case I found over the weekend? Is that\n",
    "4:48\n",
    "That seems reasonable. Um, so I had a fun one um doing some DNA\n",
    "4:54\n",
    "design, some uh synthetic biology in Solvet. Um, and you know, like this is\n",
    "4:59\n",
    "an area that I've been reading up a lot about, but I haven't used the tools extensively. And a lot of the tools involve editing sequences of base pairs\n",
    "5:07\n",
    "just as text. You know, people send each other plasmids as like Microsoft Word docs and things. Um, some of the time\n",
    "5:14\n",
    "you have tools that are designed to like make it a little bit easier. Um, but I just found doing it and solve it was\n",
    "5:20\n",
    "like night and day in terms of confidence that I'm getting things right because you can always like inspect the\n",
    "5:26\n",
    "outputs of every stage back translate. Let me go see if this still maps to the same amino acid sequence.\n",
    "5:31\n",
    "So what's going on here? I know it's not exactly an amino acids course we're doing, but I'm very interested to\n",
    "5:36\n",
    "understand what any of this means. Yeah. Um, so what's going on here is trying to design of DNA. Um and this is\n",
    "5:44\n",
    "something that we're already seeing your I guess the window you're sharing. So ah right okay that would explain um that\n",
    "5:52\n",
    "explain. There we go. Okay. Um so this is the end\n",
    "5:57\n",
    "goal is a a circular strand of DNA um called a plasmid that could then be placed into some bacteria um and then\n",
    "6:05\n",
    "they would basically execute the program that is that DNA. Um so they'd start at\n",
    "6:11\n",
    "this origin of replication and they'd make some copies of it and then um the\n",
    "6:16\n",
    "mechanisms for creating RNA and then proteins would start at um a little promoter that says you know um focus on\n",
    "6:24\n",
    "the sequence. Then there's a binding site where they attach on and then there's a sequence that codes for a\n",
    "6:29\n",
    "protein um and then there's a terminator. Um and so this lets you\n",
    "6:34\n",
    "specify a protein to be manufactured by the um bacteria. Um and so what I was\n",
    "6:40\n",
    "doing in the solvent dialogue was trying to create this this um they call that a\n",
    "6:45\n",
    "cartridge this special piece of DNA along here starting from the promoter and the ribosome binding site and the\n",
    "6:53\n",
    "protein itself and the protein I was trying to do some fancy tricks linking several subunits together. Um and so\n",
    "7:00\n",
    "historically you do that just by manually cutting and pasting bits of DNA. No way. Um this looks even harder in Python.\n",
    "7:06\n",
    "I know, right? Yeah. This like takes a while to start recognizing this is um methionine, you know, this these three\n",
    "7:12\n",
    "these three letters is going to turn into um a particular amino acid. Um yeah, even even harder than WebGL. Um\n",
    "7:19\n",
    "anyway, being able to just play around with um solve it to say, hey, could you\n",
    "7:26\n",
    "find me like the um the most common codeons to code for each amino acid? Oh, it turns out there's a library for that.\n",
    "7:32\n",
    "Um fantastic. Can I then use that to figure out what codons I need to code\n",
    "7:37\n",
    "for my specific sequence of amino acids? Um, and yeah, just iterating on this\n",
    "7:42\n",
    "idea in an environment where a there's an AI that knows a lot more biology than me and can say, hey, you know, you've\n",
    "7:49\n",
    "already got the start code on there. You don't need to add it. Or, I don't know, I caught a couple of um somewhat\n",
    "7:54\n",
    "beginner mistakes that I might have made if I just been doing it myself and had no way to catch. Um, and you can see\n",
    "8:00\n",
    "this, I mean, it's a totally different subject matter, but it felt like solve it. You're doing one step at a time.\n",
    "8:06\n",
    "You're printing out the outputs. Um, they're a little harder to verify than a nice, you know, Daisy UI component that\n",
    "8:11\n",
    "looks right. Um the uh the overall idea in this whole dialogue it turns out has\n",
    "8:17\n",
    "some flaws that that might render it um slightly less u achievable in in real\n",
    "8:23\n",
    "life but it was a really fun exercise to learn a bit more about biology with solve it there to I've got a tiny one I can show too if\n",
    "8:29\n",
    "you like um I don't know if uh I just want to check\n",
    "8:35\n",
    "my sharing here. Do you know if it shares your audio as\n",
    "8:40\n",
    "well by default? I guess we'll see. I shared this dialogue during the week.\n",
    "8:47\n",
    "Um, which is just uh I wanted mainly to tell people about\n",
    "8:56\n",
    "how nifty the torch vision and torch audio libraries are and they are built\n",
    "9:01\n",
    "into solving\n",
    "9:08\n",
    "deep learning but actually they're super powerful um libraries for all kinds of\n",
    "9:14\n",
    "things. So, for example, I wanted to create a red square. And by the way, the\n",
    "9:20\n",
    "reason I wanted to create a red square was I wanted to test uh some new code that Karum had added to solve it, which\n",
    "9:26\n",
    "is you can now pass images as variables to um solve it and it can see them. Um\n",
    "9:34\n",
    "but as I did so I thought like oh maybe people don't realize how handy this is that in PyTorch you can say oh create a\n",
    "9:43\n",
    "three-dimensional uh tensor 3x 50x 50 fill it up with the number 255\n",
    "9:50\n",
    "with int 8 unsigned in eights and then um make on the first dimension uh items\n",
    "9:57\n",
    "one and two the entire matrices equal to zero and then encode all that as a PNG\n",
    "10:03\n",
    "And you can view it using uh IPython display. Um and this kind of thing is\n",
    "10:08\n",
    "quite nice. I um I sh I showed this whole dialogue to my daughter afterwards to\n",
    "10:16\n",
    "kind of say like you know like matrices and vectors. I was like did you know you can go another dimension and that's\n",
    "10:23\n",
    "called a 3D tensor. And she was like oh of course you could why can't you do more than one? I like okay. But then she\n",
    "10:29\n",
    "was like, \"Well, wait, why would you need three dimensions for a square?\" And I said, \"Well, you tell me. Why would\n",
    "10:35\n",
    "you?\" She had a thing. Oh, this is like the other dimension for the colors. And I was like, \"Yeah.\" So, like looking at\n",
    "10:41\n",
    "this kind of stuff, it's very from scratch. It helps you visualize and understand how\n",
    "10:48\n",
    "pixels and colors and tenses work. And so, another example was um audio. Um so\n",
    "10:56\n",
    "again showed my daughter this audio example and encouraged her to think about it and tell me what it's doing. Um\n",
    "11:03\n",
    "so here we have um middle C uh and then two frequencies at\n",
    "11:11\n",
    "equal ratios above that um um and then we have all the numbers from\n",
    "11:20\n",
    "0 to two uh 32,000 of them. So SR is sample rate\n",
    "11:26\n",
    "at equally spaced. That's what linen space does. And so if we take that as\n",
    "11:31\n",
    "time and multiply it by the frequency 440 and multiply it by 2 pi and sign\n",
    "11:38\n",
    "that's a sine wave of 440 htz. If we then add them all together\n",
    "11:45\n",
    "that is literally a chord. And so we can then use IPython's audio and\n",
    "11:54\n",
    "Did you hear that? No, we didn't. Okay, trust me, that was a a chord.\n",
    "12:00\n",
    "But it was not a C chord. A couple of sharpeyed viewers in the chat said 440 is a\n",
    "12:05\n",
    "440 is a my apologies. As I said, when you're\n",
    "12:11\n",
    "streaming, brains turn off. And so that's um creating the the wave\n",
    "12:16\n",
    "itself. And then this is kind of fun. Let's now multiply the amplitude of the wave by 1 +.3\n",
    "12:25\n",
    "* uh 10 pi t and that again I'll I can\n",
    "12:32\n",
    "enjoy it you can't uh but that's the same thing with ver um but again it's kind of nice to and then you could plot\n",
    "12:38\n",
    "this with mattplot lib and it's kind of a nice way to turn\n",
    "12:43\n",
    "trigonometry into something very tangible.\n",
    "12:49\n",
    "I even wrote here a major chord. I mean it's a major chord. It could be any\n",
    "12:56\n",
    "major chord. Sure. That's true. Could be any major chord.\n",
    "13:02\n",
    "All right. Anyhoo, now what are we doing? Nice. All right. So, that was some fantastic demos of using solvit for\n",
    "13:08\n",
    "various different things. Um, and that was all manipulating stuff like we have the whole course running on solve it the\n",
    "13:15\n",
    "machine, a little tiny instance. And so you showed creating some torch tenses, but one of the things that came out this\n",
    "13:20\n",
    "week was someone trying to train a model and saying, \"Oh, it's like a tiny little virtual CPU shared between other people\n",
    "13:26\n",
    "without much memory.\" Um, it's not for training models. Um, and so the theme of\n",
    "13:32\n",
    "today is to say, how do we break out of that container if we have to? We tried to make solve it as comfortable a\n",
    "13:37\n",
    "container as possible. Um, but Jeremy is going to show us some techniques for operating other computers, other\n",
    "13:43\n",
    "people's computers, your personal computer using Solit. Um, and so we'll have a sequence of um demo slashsteps\n",
    "13:52\n",
    "tutorials around that. Um, building up to yeah, some different fun applications.\n",
    "13:57\n",
    "Um, okay, great. Um,\n",
    "14:02\n",
    "I can't begin to tell you how excited I am about this because\n",
    "14:08\n",
    "I I've basically been bouncing around the house for the last few days because\n",
    "14:14\n",
    "I've been regularly experiencing this feeling of like, oh my god, I haven't experienced an interaction with a\n",
    "14:20\n",
    "computer this exciting for years. Um,\n",
    "14:26\n",
    "and so the first thing I'm going to show you\n",
    "14:31\n",
    "is, um, let me see if I can find this. Uh, yes. I'm uh\n",
    "14:38\n",
    "I've been trying to like do I mean I've been sharing videos for years. Um\n",
    "14:46\n",
    "and I'd like to get at least somewhat less bad at it. Create the video creation. Um\n",
    "14:53\n",
    "so here's my problem. The kind of the the thing for creating videos is called\n",
    "14:58\n",
    "Da Vinci Resolve. Um, so what you could do is read the\n",
    "15:05\n",
    "manual for Da Vinci Resolve. Um, and it's a very good manual. It's very\n",
    "15:11\n",
    "thorough. Uh, the only problem is that it's quite extensive,\n",
    "15:19\n",
    "by which I mean it is over 4,200 pages long.\n",
    "15:26\n",
    "Oh my goodness. So um that's more than I have to invest\n",
    "15:33\n",
    "in this. Um so\n",
    "15:40\n",
    "what I did it is I thought okay I want to do something reasonably straightforward\n",
    "15:46\n",
    "which is I want to create you know a slightly nicer version of\n",
    "15:51\n",
    "lesson 3. Um, so I I loaded up lesson 3\n",
    "16:01\n",
    "um uh in Da Vinci and there's a nice thing that\n",
    "16:08\n",
    "um so we're now just using play and zoom recording, but Zoom actually does have a feature you can check in the settings to\n",
    "16:13\n",
    "say when you're recording keep each uh Jono's camera, Jeremy's camera,\n",
    "16:18\n",
    "screenshot separate. And so you end up with a whole bunch of separate\n",
    "16:25\n",
    "clip clips for each one. Um, which is cool. Um, I thought, okay, I\n",
    "16:34\n",
    "could like switch to the appropriate clip in nicer ways maybe than the way we did it. And also I could try to make\n",
    "16:39\n",
    "sure that Jonno and my levels were nicely calibrated. Used a little bit of audio compression. So also um\n",
    "16:48\n",
    "um nicely um\n",
    "16:53\n",
    "you also get if you ask for it separate audio files for each person in the\n",
    "16:58\n",
    "meeting so you can kind of level it and so I wanted to just make it a bit nicer.\n",
    "17:03\n",
    "Um, so I I created a dialogue.\n",
    "17:11\n",
    "Um, and I used a a pretty new feature um\n",
    "17:18\n",
    "where as as Jono indicated, today's kind of all about like how do you connect solver to the rest of the world? And so\n",
    "17:24\n",
    "perhaps the most useful thing to be able to connect solver to is just your screen. Um\n",
    "17:30\n",
    "so if you uh import dialog helper.capture\n",
    "17:37\n",
    "um then you have one little setup piece which basically\n",
    "17:42\n",
    "imports the necessary JavaScript and stuff to get this working. So you only have to run this once. Setup share. And\n",
    "17:49\n",
    "then anytime you want to pick a different window or tab or whatever to share, you stay start share. Now, you've\n",
    "17:57\n",
    "probably seen something like this before, um um where you can pick what to\n",
    "18:05\n",
    "share. And I'm going to pick my Da Vinci Resolve window to share. So, I'll click\n",
    "18:14\n",
    "share. And it pops up, and it says, okay, this is now sharing this window.\n",
    "18:24\n",
    "Um, and then the other thing I did is I just jumped into my shell and I did just did an ls so that you can see what\n",
    "18:31\n",
    "recordings I've got. Um, and I'm going to go ahead and do this from scratch.\n",
    "18:38\n",
    "Um, I said, \"Okay, I want you to help me learn the basics of creating video. I\n",
    "18:44\n",
    "want to create a high quality recording of this lesson. I've got some recordings\n",
    "18:50\n",
    "taken from Zoom.\" So, I said search to find out what views there are cuz I was like, what the hell are all these\n",
    "18:57\n",
    "different names? Um, yeah, I say I forgot to hit record. So,\n",
    "19:04\n",
    "I've got a webm file with a YouTube live. So, I said use capture tools. This is the thing we've got which can capture\n",
    "19:10\n",
    "your screen to see what's on my screen at any time. Now, um this is kind of text you want to\n",
    "19:16\n",
    "probably put in every time. Note that you won't see any earlier screenshots taken with this tool. So summarize\n",
    "19:23\n",
    "important bits of what you see so you can refer back to it later. I tried to make sure it knows everything about what\n",
    "19:28\n",
    "I'm what I have what version wise what I'm trying to do here what I'm guessing\n",
    "19:33\n",
    "is the approach and it's like okay have a look and tell me and so it said all\n",
    "19:39\n",
    "right let me look at your screen and you'll see it's run a tool here called capture tool and it's got back an image\n",
    "19:45\n",
    "which we've truncated um and so it should have seen this\n",
    "19:53\n",
    "and it's like okay you got Da Vinci Okay, these are what the filings you've\n",
    "19:59\n",
    "got are great. You've got your multicam setup set up correctly.\n",
    "20:06\n",
    "And so, um, I'm not going to run every one of these again. Um, but you get the\n",
    "20:13\n",
    "idea, right? So, so this is a big deal, Jimmy. And I see\n",
    "20:19\n",
    "someone in the chat saying like this is wild. This was I can't begin to tell you Jonno like\n",
    "20:25\n",
    "I want to go through this whole thing right it's quite long but like just like I've been trying for a couple of years\n",
    "20:32\n",
    "to get vaguely competent at this tool and I'm not at all and this whole experience was just like\n",
    "20:40\n",
    "total delight you know and all the more so because I failed so many times and\n",
    "20:45\n",
    "one of the reasons I failed is not surprisingly all the stuff about Da Vinci out there is videos and they're\n",
    "20:51\n",
    "hours long and everyone's like, \"Oh, now that you've got your node clip\n",
    "20:57\n",
    "connection set up, I'll show you this feature.\" And I'm just like, I don't know why they're all designed for people who like Da Vinci Resolve is used to\n",
    "21:04\n",
    "create like the Marvel superhero movies and you know? So, to find stuff at\n",
    "21:09\n",
    "my level, yeah, it's it is wild. It really is.\n",
    "21:15\n",
    "Um, yeah. Um, so it said like, okay, you\n",
    "21:21\n",
    "know, do some stuff, right? And now it said create a new multi-cam clip. Now,\n",
    "21:27\n",
    "what happened when I did that is it popped up a new window. So, what I could have done, um, Jonno, is I could have\n",
    "21:33\n",
    "said start share again, and that would let me share that different window it popped up. But actually, um, what I\n",
    "21:41\n",
    "didn't bother, right? because um all you need to do so if you have another window\n",
    "21:46\n",
    "like here for example um on Mac press command shift5\n",
    "21:53\n",
    "or on Windows press Windows shifts right and if I press commandshift five\n",
    "22:02\n",
    "it brings up the capture settings and make sure you pick the third one from the left capture selected portion and\n",
    "22:09\n",
    "then under options S choose clipboard and make sure that remember last\n",
    "22:15\n",
    "selection is turned off. And then you'll find that your\n",
    "22:21\n",
    "mouse icons turn into a cross. And so you can just drag over the thing you want to show it.\n",
    "22:28\n",
    "Hit enter. And then you can just go back and you can say, you know, um,\n",
    "22:37\n",
    "uh, what should I put here? Uh, hit command V, right?\n",
    "22:46\n",
    "And as you can see, it just pops that there. So, that's another way of sharing\n",
    "22:52\n",
    "the screen. And I just used that a couple of times where I was kind of just trying to grab a little bit of a different screen or a little bit of a\n",
    "22:58\n",
    "window or whatever. Um,\n",
    "23:07\n",
    "okay. Well, so so Jeremy, just to like recap for people, um, back up at the\n",
    "23:13\n",
    "top, the way you set up the original share is those two functions, the setup share\n",
    "23:19\n",
    "and the start share that came from dialog hopper. capture and that allows it to just see the\n",
    "23:25\n",
    "screen whenever it uses that tool like a snapshot of the whole whatever you just share. Yeah. Or or a window and in fact can I\n",
    "23:32\n",
    "just quickly show you tabs Jonno because tabs are really cool with tabs. Um if I wanted to look at a\n",
    "23:39\n",
    "tab I just click on a tab so you can see there's the three options this and I don't know if like it's the same on\n",
    "23:44\n",
    "Windows. I can't quite remember. I think it's similar. And you see at the top now it says sharing this tab,\n",
    "23:50\n",
    "right? Um, and so then I could say like, um,\n",
    "23:57\n",
    "you know, um, hey, here's some of the source of this\n",
    "24:04\n",
    "tool. Take a look.\n",
    "24:09\n",
    "And so now I shared a different thing, which is I'm sharing a tab. Um, and\n",
    "24:17\n",
    "it's interesting. I didn't know. Take a look. It's asking if it should. It's saying Maybe because I'm in Why did it I don't\n",
    "24:23\n",
    "know. Let's see. We have also just changed the model, right? This thinking model is now um\n",
    "24:29\n",
    "opus rather than There we go. Yeah. And so something nice about this\n",
    "24:35\n",
    "when you're doing tabs is you can then switch over and say um so which one did\n",
    "24:41\n",
    "I share just now? Capture.py. So I could then say like um share this\n",
    "24:47\n",
    "tab instead. And I could say\n",
    "24:54\n",
    "um have another look. This is the older\n",
    "25:00\n",
    "version. Um so tabs, sharing tabs are fun.\n",
    "25:05\n",
    "Sharing windows fun. Sharing screens are fun. So sorry, Jono. Um go on. Yeah. No. Um okay. So then there's lots\n",
    "25:12\n",
    "of discussion around like um are you are we just relying on the\n",
    "25:17\n",
    "model's knowledge of Da Vinci Resolve to be able to answer your questions? Um how\n",
    "25:22\n",
    "how are you deciding when to let the AI like read your screen or should you give it the manual instead?\n",
    "25:28\n",
    "What's the sort of space there? So the manual's too big, 4200 pages. Um,\n",
    "25:37\n",
    "and I did wonder about converting it into some kind of rag indexed markdown\n",
    "25:43\n",
    "thing. Um, but I only like to do work generally\n",
    "25:48\n",
    "if I know I need it. So I thought I try without it. And it turns out I did need it. Um, it was able to um, search the\n",
    "25:58\n",
    "web, right? So you can see here it searched the web. Um, and at the bottom it shows you what\n",
    "26:05\n",
    "it's linked to and it was able to see my screen. And between those two things, it\n",
    "26:10\n",
    "was always able to answer my questions. So, I didn't add any additional context.\n",
    "26:17\n",
    "Nice. Okay. So, this is cool. This feels like a a good middle ground between like just asking it to do it to give you\n",
    "26:23\n",
    "blind instructions versus like I think the other direction would be something like the Gemini live screen share where\n",
    "26:29\n",
    "you're basically streaming a video of your screen continuously to the model filling up its context window and then\n",
    "26:34\n",
    "asking it for input that side. This is kind of in between where whenever you ask solid a question it can choose to\n",
    "26:41\n",
    "take a new picture of the screen but it's not constantly streaming or constantly filling up. Yeah. I don't know why, but I never had\n",
    "26:47\n",
    "much success using Gemini Live for this, but Gemini Live would be the other product\n",
    "26:53\n",
    "in this space for sure. Um, yeah. So,\n",
    "26:58\n",
    "okay. So, it it it kind of told me, you know, create new multicam clip and then\n",
    "27:04\n",
    "I showed it and in particular, I kind of guessed what things might be important.\n",
    "27:09\n",
    "And so, I think I think I need to change the sync and audio. And it's like, yeah.\n",
    "27:14\n",
    "And it's like, okay, I've done that. Do I set this up for the audio now? It says\n",
    "27:19\n",
    "what to do. And I I had to remind it maybe with Opus 4.5 it'll be better. But it was very interesting. Um, most of the\n",
    "27:27\n",
    "time for the first few steps it would say, can you do that and tell me what you\n",
    "27:34\n",
    "see? And so I kept on editing its answer to say can you do that and I'll check your screen because it's just has it\n",
    "27:42\n",
    "Jonno and I chatted the other day and Jono you pointed out to me that like it's probably seen the can you do that\n",
    "27:47\n",
    "and tell me what you see a lot of times in the training right right every forum is you know the questions are answered by somebody who\n",
    "27:54\n",
    "doesn't have a capture screen tool so they have to rely on the old-fashioned you know meat bag types in a description\n",
    "28:00\n",
    "method and so and because That's how language\n",
    "28:05\n",
    "models are trained. Um that's what kept happening. But after three or four um I didn't have to do it anymore. You know,\n",
    "28:11\n",
    "it that kind of it got the hang of it. Um and I also said um search whenever\n",
    "28:19\n",
    "you're ready. Um so I think actually in our system prompt we tell the model don't search unless asked to because\n",
    "28:24\n",
    "otherwise it tends to go a bit wild searching all the time and it's quite slow um and kind of expensive. Um, so\n",
    "28:32\n",
    "once I did this a couple of times, it got used to searching and so it it was now great. Um, what do you do next? And\n",
    "28:39\n",
    "so again, it's to take another look at my screen. Um,\n",
    "28:47\n",
    "and then in this case, I think it checked my screen and then it searched. So I told it like, sorry, it searched\n",
    "28:53\n",
    "and then it captured my screen. I said capture my screen then search because that way you can search for something that's more suitable. Um, so I kind of\n",
    "28:59\n",
    "had to teach it to use these tools effectively. Um,\n",
    "29:06\n",
    "and it was nice cuz I have to kind of teach me she keyboard shortcuts based on where I was up to at each point.\n",
    "29:13\n",
    "Um, this is embarrassing, but like the fact that there's like two windows um in Da\n",
    "29:20\n",
    "Vinci. Um, like one here, which are currently\n",
    "29:27\n",
    "black, and one here. I just never knew what they were for, and I didn't know how to remove one of them. So, I finally\n",
    "29:33\n",
    "was able to say like, \"What are these?\" Um, yeah, it knows enough about it that\n",
    "29:38\n",
    "it didn't have to search for really basic questions like, can you tell me the most basic thing of what the main\n",
    "29:44\n",
    "screen does? Um, yeah. See, it's like, what do you see in the left viewer now? Right. So,\n",
    "29:51\n",
    "here I just figured I would just say like this and it would figure out that it should look at my screen, you know.\n",
    "29:57\n",
    "Um, so it's like, yes, you're doing it correctly. So, it really felt like having a video editing expert watching\n",
    "30:03\n",
    "over my shoulder. Um, sometimes I would correct it a little bit. So I'd say control shift\n",
    "30:09\n",
    "might okay to Mac. Um, and so I was really not just trying to finish the\n",
    "30:14\n",
    "task, but I was also trying to understand better how to become more proficient, you know.\n",
    "30:22\n",
    "Um, now this was interesting. Um, so I said,\n",
    "30:27\n",
    "okay, I've got uh five. So there's this thing called a a multicam clip.\n",
    "30:35\n",
    "um here, right? And so in the multicam clip,\n",
    "30:40\n",
    "you've got um five different synchronized views,\n",
    "30:46\n",
    "right? Showing different bits. And I wanted a way to kind of like in a live\n",
    "30:51\n",
    "sports control room just hit the number that I wanted.\n",
    "30:57\n",
    "Um and I thought or something like that. So I was like, how do I I bet that must be\n",
    "31:02\n",
    "possible. So how do I get it to work? It kind of showed me something and it\n",
    "31:07\n",
    "didn't work. Asked a couple of follow-up questions, didn't work. And I got into that bit where I was like, \"Okay, it it\n",
    "31:13\n",
    "doesn't know it's like hallucinating or whatever.\" So when I went back and I clicked on these little stars,\n",
    "31:19\n",
    "which is the source material that it found and then I actually read it, you know, and then I discovered like, oh, it\n",
    "31:26\n",
    "turns out those things only work if you click a particular thing to go in a particular mode. And now it all worked\n",
    "31:31\n",
    "in the process. I accidentally broke something. And so now I got to learn how to fix that. Um,\n",
    "31:38\n",
    "so I was like, \"Okay, now I want to make the audio better.\" I was like, \"Okay, what kinds of things do people do to\n",
    "31:44\n",
    "clean up audio?\" Because again, I didn't really know. Um, and um, it's checking my screen, seeing\n",
    "31:52\n",
    "what's what I've got. Um, gave me some options. So I was in learning mode most\n",
    "31:57\n",
    "of the time. Um, so it's doing the kind of standard learning mode thing of like saying here are the things you could do.\n",
    "32:03\n",
    "What would you like to do? Which was great. Um, and sometimes I would just step ahead and I can see,\n",
    "32:09\n",
    "hey, I just did it on my own. What do you think? Um, it's very encouraging, you know, and\n",
    "32:15\n",
    "then sometimes you can see here the prompt's empty, right? And that's because it said once you have the inspector open, let me know when I look\n",
    "32:21\n",
    "at your screen. So, I just hit command shift slash, which just sends a full stop to it in thinking mode. Um, and\n",
    "32:28\n",
    "that's all I needed to do. Press a single button and it can see that I've done it.\n",
    "32:35\n",
    "Um, so yep. Um, Jeremy, I wanted to like um\n",
    "32:42\n",
    "discuss an aspect of this which you could do this with manual screenshotting, right? You could take a\n",
    "32:48\n",
    "picture every time, paste the thing and ask your question. Yeah. But it feels like that's the same as saying, \"Oh, you\n",
    "32:53\n",
    "could do coding with chat GPT web interface, right? You could copy and paste from your terminal, like here's the error I'm getting, paste it, get\n",
    "32:58\n",
    "your response back, and once or twice, that's perfect. If you just need to ask like which of these buttons\n",
    "33:05\n",
    "ends the clip in Da Vinci, take a screenshot, paste it in. Yeah, the difference is like from pasting\n",
    "33:11\n",
    "errors back into chat GPT to like having AI in your editor or from copying and pasting terminal commands to having\n",
    "33:18\n",
    "shell sage or from working in a notebook and then going to like claude.com to having solve\n",
    "33:25\n",
    "it. You asked 50 questions there. Whereas if you were screenshotting and manually\n",
    "33:32\n",
    "composing the context every time in a fresh chat bubble, I would guess that\n",
    "33:37\n",
    "you'd probably ask 10 and then say, \"Cool, I'll figure out the rest.\" Yeah. So there's something about I could have\n",
    "33:42\n",
    "done this before, right? And I didn't. Um so yeah, I think for me\n",
    "33:49\n",
    "that overhead was too much for for me to to keep focused. The fact that it was\n",
    "33:54\n",
    "constantly looking at the same window and it could decide when it wanted to see what was on that window\n",
    "34:01\n",
    "made this a very smooth experience. And um\n",
    "34:07\n",
    "interestingly, there was no um there was never a point where the\n",
    "34:12\n",
    "fact that it didn't have a video of my last five minutes was a problem. Right. Um so that was interesting. And one of\n",
    "34:19\n",
    "the other interesting things here, Jono, is this\n",
    "34:25\n",
    "was the first time I had used this system, which was kind of months in the making. Um, as you'll see in a moment,\n",
    "34:32\n",
    "the amount of code was tiny, but a lot of pieces are working together\n",
    "34:38\n",
    "here. And it was kind of nerve-wracking and\n",
    "34:43\n",
    "exciting for me to be at a point like, okay, today the pieces are all there for me to finally that thing I had in my head 6 months ago, I can I can do it.\n",
    "34:50\n",
    "And like I was never able to explain to anybody very well what I wanted to do. I\n",
    "34:55\n",
    "just had a vision of it. And then to go through it and see like\n",
    "35:01\n",
    "yeah, it's happening was great. And like little things like the fact that we\n",
    "35:07\n",
    "truncate nearly the whole image in the history is critical, right? Because if it was\n",
    "35:14\n",
    "taking all these screenshots and it was filling up my context and it's going to get dumber and dumber that would really\n",
    "35:19\n",
    "piss me off, you know, right? So this kind of experiment of like, hey,\n",
    "35:26\n",
    "use you write notes for yourself to say what's on the screen so that you don't\n",
    "35:32\n",
    "get lost. I didn't know any of that would work, but yeah, it all it all did. So, yeah.\n",
    "35:38\n",
    "So, when the prompt executes, it grabs the screenshot, it's available\n",
    "35:43\n",
    "throughout the execution of that prompt, web searches, whatever. And then once the prompt's finished, it's gone, you\n",
    "35:51\n",
    "know, and so it doesn't clog up the context. And then when\n",
    "35:57\n",
    "if I have something which I do want to stay there for the whole context, I can do command shift 5 paste and now that is\n",
    "36:05\n",
    "there. So it's kind of nice to have these tools all in place, you know.\n",
    "36:14\n",
    "Um, so one nice thing here was it told me so one thing I did do as I\n",
    "36:22\n",
    "pasted I took the release notes for version 20 of Resolve which just came\n",
    "36:29\n",
    "out. Uh, stuck them into R.gena.ai and pasted those into the context. So it\n",
    "36:36\n",
    "wouldn't have otherwise known that there's an AI dialogue level that just came out. Um so um it then said, \"Oh, why don't\n",
    "36:45\n",
    "you try that?\" I said, \"Okay, I I'll try it.\" And um\n",
    "36:55\n",
    "I made a couple of choices and it was able to kind of comment. It was able to check the choices I'd made.\n",
    "37:01\n",
    "It's like, \"Okay, done it for yours. Now do it for Jono's.\" little things like I made sure that I renamed my files so\n",
    "37:09\n",
    "that we could you know you can see the file names and so it's nice to be able to talk about Jonno and talk about\n",
    "37:15\n",
    "Jeremy and it knows that I'm Jeremy and stuff. Um so this AI dialogue level it\n",
    "37:20\n",
    "was great. Basically the things that it told me we would need to do uh it did\n",
    "37:25\n",
    "all three of the first ones without any interaction. So thank you AI at a meta\n",
    "37:31\n",
    "level as well. Um, and so it's never seen it before either, but it was able to do a search to find out a bit more\n",
    "37:37\n",
    "about it. Um, so then I finally inserted that bit where I forgot to press record\n",
    "37:42\n",
    "and then it had a big like zoom picture on it. So I had it kind of tell me how to get rid of that. And little things\n",
    "37:48\n",
    "like, okay, screen, you know, I didn't know this. You could just type a time code and hit enter and it jumps straight\n",
    "37:55\n",
    "there. Um, so I'm really trying to become more competent at the program\n",
    "38:02\n",
    "through this process. Took advantage of things I know. So it turned out the original webm didn't work. So I\n",
    "38:09\n",
    "converted it with ffmpeg. Um, okay. It told me how to crop it out. Um,\n",
    "38:17\n",
    "and as you can see every time it's saying details, that's it looking at my screen. Not my screen, my window again.\n",
    "38:25\n",
    "Um, so then I was kind of, um, this was fun. I then, um, went into YouTube and\n",
    "38:32\n",
    "copied the transcript. Um, so you can, um, download transcripts.\n",
    "38:40\n",
    "Um, but, um, easier still is to,\n",
    "38:48\n",
    "um, it's a good way to do this. Oh, I know. A really easy way to do it is\n",
    "38:57\n",
    "I go to solve it and the one I was doing was uh lesson\n",
    "39:03\n",
    "three.\n",
    "39:09\n",
    "Um so you can get to the transcript\n",
    "39:14\n",
    "here. It's right at the bottom. And I know this is slightly clunky, but it's not too bad. So, if I just double click\n",
    "39:20\n",
    "on the or drag along the top bit and then scroll down to the bottom and hold\n",
    "39:26\n",
    "down shift and click. There you go. That's copied the whole thing. So, that's all I did. And then I just opened\n",
    "39:35\n",
    "a note. And uh actually even better maybe rather the note would be raw.\n",
    "39:42\n",
    "Um that way it won't do anything with it. Um and then I just hit I to close it\n",
    "39:47\n",
    "up so I don't need to see it. And then I said, \"Great. I've pasted the transcript above. This is so fun. I loved this.\" I\n",
    "39:53\n",
    "just said, \"Can you see any bits where something, you know, we might want to delete something.\"\n",
    "39:58\n",
    "So it's like, \"Yep, you know, he talked about some resolution issues.\" Oh, Jonno's keyboard overlay was blocking\n",
    "40:04\n",
    "it. Um, got a bit slow at one point.\n",
    "40:09\n",
    "Couple of things here about realizing my rejects had worked when I thought it didn't. I remember that. As accidentally\n",
    "40:15\n",
    "imprompt, you know, blah blah blah. And I like the way it did a good job of saying like actually some of these help\n",
    "40:20\n",
    "give it a lateral eye feel. So which is cool cuz I I actually agreed entirely. That was what I thought too. Um\n",
    "40:28\n",
    "so I said cool and I said well don't forget the time stamps are now 4 minutes and 3 seconds off because I inserted 4\n",
    "40:33\n",
    "minutes and 3 seconds on the start. So it gave me a list of the things. It\n",
    "40:39\n",
    "reminded me how to do keyboard shortcuts. Um gave me a couple of different\n",
    "40:45\n",
    "approaches I could use. Um, actually it turned out not to work for me. So then it checked my screen to\n",
    "40:52\n",
    "see what was going on and it did a search and it's like, oh, turns out you have to press equals to move the\n",
    "40:58\n",
    "timeline rather than the source. It's like, okay, that was really fun.\n",
    "41:04\n",
    "Um, so yeah, and um, finally\n",
    "41:10\n",
    "delivery. um kind of explored a few different options, wondered about uh expanding it\n",
    "41:17\n",
    "to uh 4K because it turned out it was a um standard HD rather than 4K HD. Now\n",
    "41:25\n",
    "they've got an AD upsizing HD upizing thing. It showed me how to do the first\n",
    "41:31\n",
    "5 minutes um so I could like check it out and looked at it. I was like, \"Oh, that is a bit better, but it also was like slower\n",
    "41:37\n",
    "than real time.\" So it's like, \"No, it's not enough better to be worth it.\" So um\n",
    "41:42\n",
    "I ended up not doing that upsizing and then finally I wanted to share the dialogue with all you guys. So I said\n",
    "41:49\n",
    "use add message to go back and add header notes before each section.\n",
    "41:54\n",
    "Um and one nice thing that is somewhat recent for this is that now if you just\n",
    "42:01\n",
    "press right arrow so you see here I am on a H2 right? If I um press right arrow\n",
    "42:09\n",
    "again, it'll take me to the next H2 and then to the next H2. So that made it very easy. Um or of course I could use\n",
    "42:16\n",
    "control shiftV um to see where it put them. And so then\n",
    "42:21\n",
    "when this is published,\n",
    "42:28\n",
    "uh you guys get to use that as well. And also helps me go back and reorganize.\n",
    "42:34\n",
    "Um, but yeah, I mean that's it. And so you remember John, I after I did that, I\n",
    "42:40\n",
    "jumped on our local on our internal Discord and it's like, oh my god, this is so cool. Yep.\n",
    "42:47\n",
    "Really exciting. Excellent. Thank you, Jeremy. That was a good a good one to start with. Um,\n",
    "42:52\n",
    "there's a question, can solve it drive the app you share? And an emphatic answer in the chat, no, it can't. Um, so\n",
    "42:58\n",
    "I don't know. Do we want to segue into the next section of deploying things with\n",
    "43:04\n",
    "no worries? Absolutely it can. Yes, to some extent. Um I mean it can do anything. So um so\n",
    "43:11\n",
    "what have we shown so far? Um I'm going to show you how it works.\n",
    "43:17\n",
    "Um but like um dialogue helper which is what capture\n",
    "43:22\n",
    "share uses is open source. Um, and there's nothing\n",
    "43:29\n",
    "in solve it that supports anything you just saw directly. So you could have\n",
    "43:35\n",
    "written dialog helper.capture. By you, I mean all of you. Like it's not um\n",
    "43:43\n",
    "doesn't require any serverside stuff. So let me show you how it's written. I'm not going to like explain in detail. Um,\n",
    "43:50\n",
    "so I'll stop sharing.\n",
    "44:03\n",
    "Um, so you can go to answer.ai/dialoghelper\n",
    "44:08\n",
    "and capture. py is the thing that does it. And this is the entire other than um\n",
    "44:16\n",
    "imports. Uh this is the entirety of the code. Of\n",
    "44:21\n",
    "course, it fits on one screen. Be embarrassing if we wrote something that didn't fit on our screen. Um, so what\n",
    "44:28\n",
    "happened at the start when I hit setup sharing? Setup share. So, what did\n",
    "44:34\n",
    "it do? Um, so I if is a function that just creates a a JavaScript function\n",
    "44:40\n",
    "basically inserts it into your your DOM into your page and it grabbed a\n",
    "44:48\n",
    "JavaScript file and read it and stuck it into your DOM. Um, so I'll come back to\n",
    "44:55\n",
    "the JavaScript file in a moment. Uh, when I clicked start share, it fired a\n",
    "45:02\n",
    "share screen event. Uh so each time I click it, it'll just fire that again to\n",
    "45:07\n",
    "let me reshare a different part of the screen. Uh each time I said amperand\n",
    "45:12\n",
    "capture tool, um it called this function which first of all tried to capture the screen which\n",
    "45:20\n",
    "would do an event get capture screen. It would then try to make sure that that contained an image data attribute and if\n",
    "45:27\n",
    "it did uh yep, if it did, it would return it. Um and then if it was\n",
    "45:33\n",
    "successful it would create a what's called a tool response which is a thing from let um which is basically to say\n",
    "45:39\n",
    "like okay this is something that let knows is a response to a tool this is the type of response and this is the\n",
    "45:46\n",
    "contents and this is basically how um anthropic API openai they all basically\n",
    "45:52\n",
    "have the same format where you say type image URL then the image URL contains data\n",
    "45:58\n",
    "um something I wanted to say though is well actually I guess I'll show you the JS as\n",
    "46:04\n",
    "well. So here's the JavaScript and again much less than a line of a\n",
    "46:10\n",
    "screen. Um so we called that share screen event. So, we have an event\n",
    "46:16\n",
    "listener that listens for a share screen event in JavaScript. And when it gets one, it tries to basically just use the\n",
    "46:24\n",
    "your browser's um API to grab a video track and that's\n",
    "46:29\n",
    "what causes it to play. And then when we send off the capture screen event, it\n",
    "46:35\n",
    "tries to call get screenshot, which is something which grabs that video that we\n",
    "46:41\n",
    "just built, captures it. there's a maximum size. So, we scale it to that\n",
    "46:46\n",
    "size, stick it onto a canvas, scale the canvas, draw the image into it, and send\n",
    "46:52\n",
    "that back as a data URL. So, it's all a bit clunky JavaScript. You know, these kind of APIs are often a bit messy. um\n",
    "46:58\n",
    "this kind of stuff um AI helps a lot with um\n",
    "47:06\n",
    "something I wanted to say though is like conceptually I can describe what's going on here very easily which is to say okay\n",
    "47:12\n",
    "in order to capture the screen fire off the capture screen event which we'll\n",
    "47:18\n",
    "call that event handler we just saw um and that then returns some data which you then get and so event get calls it\n",
    "47:24\n",
    "and gets the data from the event and then we can return it Um to start sharing we fire off the\n",
    "47:32\n",
    "share screen event that doesn't return anything. So um\n",
    "47:37\n",
    "this is not at all what it looked like at first, right? So 3 weeks ago\n",
    "47:43\n",
    "um it looked like this. Lots of code and there's none of these\n",
    "47:51\n",
    "abstractions, right? Um there's all this like send data to server and\n",
    "47:58\n",
    "UUIDS and JS loaded and data.gets gets and\n",
    "48:05\n",
    "stuff, right? So, um\n",
    "48:11\n",
    "I wouldn't have felt comfortable saying like, \"Hey everybody, you can now have solve it talk for JavaScript. Just do\n",
    "48:18\n",
    "all this.\" Like I I I can't even describe what it's doing cuz it's like stuff we had globbed together. Um um but\n",
    "48:26\n",
    "we gradually refactored it, you know. Uh Nate and I both had a go and\n",
    "48:34\n",
    "you know we we just did what we've described many times is we found little duplicate bits of code and refactored\n",
    "48:40\n",
    "them into functions and then we were like well what what's that function doing exactly? So for example, fire\n",
    "48:48\n",
    "event is a function that's now part of core.\n",
    "48:53\n",
    "Um\n",
    "49:03\n",
    "and it's not very big, you know, but um it calls htmx.t trigger\n",
    "49:11\n",
    "um the event that you've asked for and you can also pass in some data for the event\n",
    "49:17\n",
    "if you wish in which case it gets added to it. So, we're kind of like it's JavaScript, right? But we're kind of\n",
    "49:24\n",
    "creating this Python API um or that um that event get thing\n",
    "49:32\n",
    "um you know, first calls fire event and then pops the data back out.\n",
    "49:38\n",
    "Um and so we kind of ended up with something which is still on the advanced\n",
    "49:43\n",
    "end, right? Not many people are going to write their own one of these but some of you will and I feel like I can now\n",
    "49:51\n",
    "support this. I can say to you, okay, this this is how you have solve\n",
    "49:56\n",
    "interface with JavaScript. And JavaScript\n",
    "50:02\n",
    "can do a lot, you know. So, not only can it see your screen, it can record your audio, it can read and modify your file\n",
    "50:09\n",
    "system, it can connect to Bluetooth devices, it can use your accelerometer.\n",
    "50:16\n",
    "It's, you know, it's quite cool. It's quite a powerful piece. So yeah.\n",
    "50:22\n",
    "Yeah. Anyh who um yeah. So let's keep digging um down\n",
    "50:29\n",
    "through the layers here. So So that's one way that we can talk to the rest of the world is by having it see our\n",
    "50:36\n",
    "screen. Uh it can't do anything to you to to to you, but through JavaScript you can actually do quite a lot.\n",
    "50:43\n",
    "Um um but being able to see is great.\n",
    "50:48\n",
    "Um, now the next thing I wanted to do was to let it um change things on my computer.\n",
    "50:57\n",
    "And my goal here was to have it um use my own computer's web browser to to\n",
    "51:04\n",
    "browse. Um, so in the past we've seen how we can use online APIs to kind of go\n",
    "51:12\n",
    "to websites and take screenshots and stuff. But for example, Rachel mentioned the other day, hey, I watched the\n",
    "51:19\n",
    "lesson. I've got 20 websites I want to take screenshots of, but like when I try\n",
    "51:24\n",
    "to do it with the online service, it the screenshots have a thing on the top saying like, do you accept cookies or\n",
    "51:30\n",
    "another one has a thing saying you have to log in or whatever. So, it's much better if it can use your browser. And\n",
    "51:37\n",
    "also, sometimes you want to be able to like have it like fill in a form and click on something or whatever. So, it's\n",
    "51:43\n",
    "nice if you can actually use your own browser. And to get to that point,\n",
    "51:49\n",
    "there's a lot that we're going to do. Um, the first thing we're going to do is\n",
    "51:55\n",
    "we're going to connect from solver to your computer using SSH.\n",
    "52:02\n",
    "So, SSH is kind of the universal connector for computers\n",
    "52:08\n",
    "nowadays. It's highly secure. Um, it uses public key encryption. Um, so\n",
    "52:14\n",
    "nobody else is going to be able to use it as well. Um,\n",
    "52:19\n",
    "it's also very convenient and it can also do a whole lot. Um, now, uh,\n",
    "52:26\n",
    "generally speaking, most people's computers don't have an internet IP address.\n",
    "52:31\n",
    "You can give it an internet IP address by going into your router and asking it to forward a port. Um, but that's\n",

    "annoying. Um so the convenient way to let solvent\n",

    "SSH to your computer um is to create a kind of a tunnel basically to basic to\n",
    "52:50\n",

    "52:58\n",
    "will then um give us a kind of an IP that solver can connect to. Um so I knew\n",
    "53:06\n",
    "a few ways to do this. Um, so but I still I always like to ask\n",
    "53:11\n",
    "anyway and again I'm in learning mode so I'm telling it a bit about myself um\n",
    "53:17\n",
    "before I start and just like okay you're experienced so I just jump straight in.\n",
    "53:22\n",
    "Um and also I quite like to\n",
    "53:28\n",
    "try new things. So normally I for this I use something called Enrock. Um but I\n",
    "53:33\n",

    "great. Yep. Uh, where does an Endrock t-shirt come\n",
    "53:44\n",

    "only knows one little thing. Um, so yeah, uh, anyway, bit of a diversion.\n",

    "56:53\n",
    "a little bit annoying like this, I don't feel comfortable saying to people, okay, you have to do this really annoying\n",
    "56:59\n",
    "thing. So step one for me was to be like, okay, does it work? And then once\n",
    "57:04\n",
    "it does, um, let's make it much easier for people to use. This is how easy it is to again make the world a slightly\n",
    "57:10\n",
    "better place. So um, I've actually done this enough times before that I've\n",
    "57:15\n",
    "already provided something. So it said, okay, you can install from pre-built binaries that are on the releases page.\n",
    "57:22\n",
    "Releases page. Okay, here is the releases page. A lot of steps, right? particularly to end up getting this onto\n",
    "57:30\n",
    "solve it while we actually need it on our local computer. Um, so I just like everything to be easy for everybody. So\n",
    "57:37\n",
    "I wrote this thing called latest.fast.ai. If you use the URL/ latest and then just\n",
    "57:44\n",
    "paste in the um name and\n",
    "57:49\n",
    "um of the organization or person and the repo.\n",
    "57:55\n",
    "So in other words, paste in Yeah, paste in that.\n",
    "58:02\n",
    "Then it returns a list of and this is like I think this\n",
    "58:08\n",
    "is like eight lines of fast HTML code or something to implement latest.io. Um that returns everything and then\n",
    "58:16\n",
    "another thing that I added to it is that if you add something one more bit after that it treats that as a regular\n",
    "58:21\n",
    "expression. So if you search for that, you will find\n",
    "58:28\n",
    "that, right? Um, and so I did this to show the AI um how this works. So I\n",
    "58:37\n",
    "didn't have to tell it because I've shown it. So I just said, \"Hey, I've got this thing. Uh, write a bash script that\n",
    "58:43\n",
    "just grabs the latest one.\" Um so it's you know you don't have to know all this\n",
    "58:49\n",
    "but you name minus M um is a thing that um\n",
    "58:58\n",
    "you name yeah there you name minus M for example\n",
    "59:04\n",
    "is a thing that tells you what type of CPU you have. So, it like checks that and figures out what kind of CPU, what\n",
    "59:12\n",
    "operating system you have, uses that to figure out what latest URL it should use, grabs that URL, and then it grabs\n",
    "59:20\n",
    "it, decompresses it, and tells you it's done.\n",
    "59:25\n",
    "Um, so I just tried pasting it directly in here and I ran it and oh, it worked.\n",
    "59:32\n",
    "Um, and I tried running it. Oh, it worked.\n",
    "59:38\n",
    "Um so I noticed it wait by mistake which I fixed. Um so I then um popped that in a\n",
    "59:45\n",
    "gist which I will share and so now anybody can install it with a single line which is nice. Um,\n",
    "59:53\n",
    "so\n",
    "1:00:01\n",
    "T-Max. Okay.\n",
    "1:00:10\n",
    "Setup share. Oops. Need to run everything above. So, shift A to run above.\n",
    "1:00:21\n",
    "All right. And start share. Okay. Let's share my terminal window. Again, you could use\n",
    "1:00:28\n",
    "something like shell sage for this instead. Um,\n",
    "1:00:33\n",
    "so and then I said, \"All right, uh, show me the B. I mean, this is actually just for you. I already know this back to front, but uh, just to give you an idea,\n",
    "1:00:40\n",
    "how do I use T-Max and SSH forwarding?\" Right?\n",
    "1:00:45\n",
    "tell it where I'm up to and it said, \"Okay, okay, I can see your T-Max session, right? You can create a new\n",
    "1:00:52\n",
    "T-Max window with control B C.\" So, anybody who hasn't used T-Max before, please do. It's amazing. B C Okay, it\n",
    "1:01:02\n",
    "basically lets you create like multiple um\n",
    "1:01:07\n",
    "kind of little windows like this as you can see. um switch between them. Uh you\n",
    "1:01:15\n",
    "can come back to at any time. Um so I do suggest looking at this dialogue\n",
    "1:01:22\n",
    "and running through it. Um like okay, how do I name this window? Um\n",
    "1:01:29\n",
    "because it said you can list all the windows with controlB wtrlb oops bw. So, I've got two windows. Um,\n",
    "1:01:38\n",
    "but they're not very meaningful. So, it' be nice to name them. Um,\n",
    "1:01:46\n",
    "uh, so, okay. So, we could run bore now. Bore.\n",
    "1:01:52\n",
    "Um, and it tells me how to use it. And hopefully it's now in my history.\n",
    "1:01:59\n",
    "That's not. Never mind. So, bore local. Okay. Okay. So, we need a two or local\n",
    "1:02:07\n",
    "um in fact branch was the Yeah, I think I also need the to write\n",
    "1:02:13\n",
    "which port I want. So, bore.\n",
    "1:02:18\n",
    "Here we are. Bore local. Now, what port do you want to share? And the answer is always 22. That's my SSH port. And so,\n",
    "1:02:26\n",
    "uh on Mac, uh Sulvic or any search can help you. There's actually a switch you\n",
    "1:02:32\n",
    "can turn on in Mac to to turn on SSH server. You don't have to set anything\n",
    "1:02:37\n",
    "up or install anything. It's part of Mac already. Um I think Windows WSL comes\n",
    "1:02:44\n",
    "with SHD, so you can also run it there. Um so then I just say\n",
    "1:02:50\n",
    "to bore.pub.\n",
    "1:02:55\n",
    "Um, and actually something that's nifty I discovered is now if I\n",
    "1:03:00\n",
    "um take a lookb.\n",
    "1:03:10\n",
    "It's quite neat. It's actually um you can see at the bottom actually\n",
    "1:03:15\n",
    "it's named it bore. So I can actually see what each of my windows is doing which is quite nifty.\n",
    "1:03:21\n",
    "Um so the important thing now um so what I actually did was I then restarted\n",
    "1:03:27\n",
    "sharing um with my local terminal. So open up this terminal and we should be\n",
    "1:03:34\n",
    "able to um SSH. So I run T-Max here as well. So this is this terminal is\n",
    "1:03:40\n",
    "looking at my solv server. This terminal is looking at my local computer.\n",
    "1:03:46\n",
    "Um, and actually I want to use the same port\n",
    "1:03:51\n",
    "I used last time. And I remember you can actually do that\n",
    "1:03:56\n",
    "too. Um, bore local.\n",
    "1:04:02\n",
    "Let's say help. Here we go. You can actually say what port to use minus P.\n",
    "1:04:09\n",
    "And that way everything's going to just keep working. There we go. Um,\n",
    "1:04:16\n",
    "so that's port 6134. So the first time I did it, it was on a different port and I realized I should keep it consistent. So\n",
    "1:04:27\n",
    "SSH to\n",
    "1:04:39\n",
    "61341 613 41 Okay. And my username is Jay\n",
    "1:04:45\n",
    "Howard. And if someone else tried this command,\n",
    "1:04:50\n",
    "they wouldn't get in because they don't have permissions, right? So it's not um not scary to share this URL or anything\n",
    "1:04:56\n",
    "like that. Exactly. Yeah, that's exactly right. So, and so I would only use SSH, right?\n",
    "1:05:02\n",
    "Because anything else people I bet there are people who are randomly trying ports on board.pub. And so if you're sharing\n",
    "1:05:08\n",
    "some unsecured port, that would be a problem. So you can see here I've typed ls to look at my first three things. And\n",
    "1:05:15\n",
    "if I go to my um so as you can see I still got bore\n",
    "1:05:21\n",
    "running in the background. So I switch to the other window and I could type ls pipe head three.\n",
    "1:05:27\n",
    "Um oh that's different. Why is that? Um\n",
    "1:05:36\n",
    "uses J. Howard uses J. Howard. That's interesting. Oh\n",
    "1:05:41\n",
    "different orders. Um right. So this is using a different shell that is not\n",
    "1:05:48\n",
    "which is treating uh the same different capitalizations as the same. So that's\n",
    "1:05:53\n",
    "quite funny. Um but you can see aws back aws. Um\n",
    "1:06:00\n",
    "so it's also there. Um oh actually so that's something that we're going to see why that happens in a moment and fix it\n",
    "1:06:06\n",
    "up. Um but so basically to summarize Jonno\n",
    "1:06:12\n",
    "Mhm. What we've got now is a way that um\n",
    "1:06:17\n",
    "solve it has connected to my computer\n",
    "1:06:23\n",
    "and it can do stuff on it. And so maybe before we have our break, I'll just quickly show what that means we can now\n",
    "1:06:29\n",
    "do. Well, before you even show it doing something, there's a a question in the chat. They said, \"We didn't see you enter a password. How did how can solve\n",
    "1:06:36\n",
    "it access it, but nobody else can.\" So maybe that's an important piece, too. Absolutely. Yeah. Absolutely. Um,\n",
    "1:06:48\n",
    "so um the reason for that is because I have\n",
    "1:06:55\n",
    "a uh Whoopsy Daisy.\n",
    "1:07:00\n",
    "Oh, you're in your remote machine. I am in my remote machine. Isn't that confusing? Your laptop.\n",
    "1:07:08\n",
    "Uh so on solve it I have a SSH directory and in that I have a um\n",
    "1:07:16\n",
    "a key. Um and so what I did I did I took my public key and then I pasted that um\n",
    "1:07:23\n",
    "into my local um\n",
    "1:07:31\n",
    "authorized keys file. So, this says that that private key um or the private key\n",
    "1:07:36\n",
    "attached to that public key is allowed to connect to this computer. And again, there's no nothing insecure about me\n",
    "1:07:42\n",
    "showing you this. This the most you could do with this is let me log into your computer. This is not my private\n",
    "1:07:48\n",
    "key. So, if you're not familiar with how um\n",
    "1:07:54\n",
    "SSH keys work, it's well worth asking solvent about them and practicing with\n",
    "1:07:59\n",
    "them. It's a really important idea, but it's it's a super secure and convenient system. And so you can either copy a\n",
    "1:08:07\n",
    "private key you already have just upload it and to solve it and put it in SSH or\n",
    "1:08:12\n",
    "you can type SSH- keygen not but SSH\n",
    "1:08:20\n",
    "um and that will create a key for you. So those are your options.\n",
    "1:08:30\n",
    "Um, okay. So, I've uh closed that SSH connection. But check this out. If I now\n",
    "1:08:37\n",
    "create a variable with the port and I create two little functions, a\n",
    "1:08:43\n",
    "function called shell, which simply runs subprocess.r run. So it's just going to run a program\n",
    "1:08:50\n",
    "and return it sted out or sted and then remote which is going to call\n",
    "1:08:57\n",
    "shell to pass a command to SSH on a\n",
    "1:09:03\n",
    "particular port with a particular user and a particular host and we'll pass all\n",
    "1:09:08\n",
    "that off to bash. Um, and so I can then say, great, let's use remote to view the\n",
    "1:09:16\n",
    "first three files in the home directory. And I run it. And so that's going to\n",
    "1:09:23\n",
    "call SSH and do that. So I can even make that\n",
    "1:09:29\n",
    "available as a tool, right? And this is where I was like, oh, it's weird. It's kind of got this strange error and it's\n",
    "1:09:34\n",
    "in a weird order. And I realized it's actually not using my shell. So I asked\n",
    "1:09:40\n",
    "for a little bit of help on why it's not using my proper shell. It helped me go through a few things. It was even like\n",
    "1:09:46\n",
    "so it's it's calling remote to find out about my local computer. So it's now\n",
    "1:09:52\n",
    "debugging for me why it's calling the wrong shell. It can see all that so it can figure out\n",
    "1:09:59\n",
    "what's going on and then it can tell me how to change my function.\n",
    "1:10:05\n",
    "Um, and eventually it realizes, ah, instead of saying bash, you should have said\n",
    "1:10:11\n",
    "dollar shell. And so I made that one change to remote. I think I sent this to you, Jono. Um, and now\n",
    "1:10:20\n",
    "there it is. So if I was feeling ridiculously brave, I could now say,\n",
    "1:10:26\n",
    "hey, use amperand back ticks remote to\n",
    "1:10:31\n",
    "to do anything, right? And it can now do anything cuz everything you can pretty much do through mouse you can also do\n",
    "1:10:38\n",
    "through the CLA. And this this has access to all of your computer. It can\n",
    "1:10:43\n",
    "read and write files, edit things, change system settings,\n",
    "1:10:48\n",
    "turn your computer off uh etc.\n",
    "1:10:55\n",
    "So maybe maybe not recommended but theoretically possible. Right. And so, as you'll see when we\n",
    "1:11:00\n",
    "come back from our break, I decided not to make it at all, but instead I it was\n",
    "1:11:06\n",
    "tool like in that I just hit the W button. You know, I'd say make, you know, write the code and I'd hit W, I'd\n",
    "1:11:12\n",
    "check it and I'd run it. Fantastic. Okay.\n",
    "1:11:17\n",
    "Should we have a break? Should we have a break? What what I've done is pasted a URL into the chat and\n",
    "1:11:23\n",
    "you're going to see some buttons like this. Oh. Um, and so what, um, that's going to\n",
    "1:11:29\n",
    "do, if I share a different window instead, um, this will give us something pretty to look at while we're on break.\n",
    "1:11:35\n",
    "And hopefully you as the chat can, um, explore around this landscape and we'll explain it when we come back. Does that\n",
    "1:11:41\n",
    "sound good? Awesome. All right, I'll see you in five minutes. See you, Jeremy.\n",
    "1:18:12\n",
    "Hi. Hey. Hey. What's been happening here?\n",
    "1:18:20\n",
    "Everybody's been uh causing mysterious movements to happen. So, I think we should um\n",
    "1:18:26\n",
    "yeah, maybe uh explore what's going on there. Thanks everyone for your um\n",
    "1:18:32\n",
    "participation. Right, let me load up the dialogue. And\n",
    "1:18:38\n",
    "so somebody in the chat asked Solvit. Solvet says, \"This appears to be a stress pattern visualization.\" No, I\n",
    "1:18:44\n",
    "don't think that's right at all. Is it? No, not the colorful interference patterns called photo elastic fringes.\n",

    "remote controlling a microscope, a Raspberry Pi powered microscope slide scanner. Um, so just to\n",
    "1:19:10\n",
    "give you a little bit of background, the um thing we were looking at there is slightly out of focus. My apologies, but\n",
    "1:19:16\n",
    "is um some very colorful crystals looked at under it's called polarized light\n",
    "1:19:21\n",
    "microscopy. Um, and so the colors are dependent on the thickness and orientation of the crystal structure.\n",
    "1:19:28\n",
    "Um, and I love love love taking photos of different crystals with this setup. Um, stitching together big images of a\n",

    "puddle of slowly crystallized um, material, usually uh, vitamin C or um,\n",
    "1:19:43\n",
    "some of them are like epsilon or citric acid. So these are pictures you've taken.\n",
    "1:19:48\n",
    "These are pictures I've taken. And the trick here is that you're using polarization to display colors you\n",
    "1:19:56\n",
    "wouldn't otherwise see. Exactly. Yeah. So, this just looks white if you look at it in normal light, but\n",
    "1:20:03\n",
    "if you have some polarizing film before and after it, you can see how much it twists the light and that gives\n",
    "1:20:08\n",
    "different colors depending on how much um thickness of crystal there is. Um but the main thing is\n",
    "1:20:14\n",
    "solid apparently is saying that the type of visualization it said is commonly created using polarized light passing\n",
    "1:20:20\n",
    "through transparent materials. So okay very much pass very much the same idea.\n",
    "1:20:27\n",
    "Um yeah so um the demo here in some ways\n",
    "1:20:33\n",
    "is going to I'm I'm going to restart so that people stop making the um printer move around.\n",
    "1:20:39\n",

    "another computer. You can see this little green um, square here. Um, this is, it turns out, a very capable ARM\n",

    "processor with some RAM and some storage and the ability to connect a camera. So,\n",
    "1:20:59\n",

    "can look at different parts of the sample at a time. So you're not going to be really using the Z axis, but the XYaxis of the 3D\n",

    "1:21:26\n",
    "a little bit blurry cuz I I just kind of clipped the slide on there and I didn't spend much time focusing. Um, but if we\n",
    "1:21:32\n",
    "did very small like.1 mm up or down, it would have gotten sharper. Um, and we could have seen more detail. Um, cool.\n",

    "1:23:13\n",
    "that it can um Can we see it? Yeah. Yeah, let's do it. Um, I guess I should uh\n",
    "1:23:20\n",
    "hit I to to reveal. Um, basically let it list files or if we want to look at a\n",
    "1:23:27\n",
    "specific file or maybe a specific segment of a file um we can do that using this R view tool. And you can see\n",
    "1:23:35\n",
    "it's got um types and a string so that solve it can use this as a tool. So this looks like it might have been\n",
    "1:23:40\n",
    "copied from or heavily inspired by stuff we've kind of seen before with the text editor API. Yeah. So, actually what I\n",
    "1:23:47\n",
    "did was I imported the um the fast core tools list of tools and then I asked solve it. Um I want\n",
    "1:23:54\n",
    "code for the equivalent of these file edit tools that operate on the remote Raspberry Pi. Nice. Um and I wrote the full set and used it\n",
    "1:24:01\n",
    "a little bit but then I got pretty disgruntled with that flow of using. So the only ones I ended up using are um\n",
    "1:24:08\n",
    "the one for using GP to search and the one for using uh view to inspect. M\n",
    "1:24:13\n",
    "um but this gives solver the ability to kind of poke around on this remote machine. So if I said using these two\n",
    "1:24:19\n",
    "tools view and and um GP can you take a peek in this folder where I've previously done some experimenting.\n",
    "1:24:25\n",
    "Okay. Can I just stop? I just say at the top of your screen there. So the definition of RRG which is remote rip\n",
    "1:24:30\n",
    "grip. You're not actually using rip grip. You're close enough is that it's calling remote. Remote is\n",
    "1:24:35\n",
    "in turn calling SSH and is passing the GP function to it.\n",
    "1:24:41\n",
    "So you've kind of got a total of like six lines of code maybe altogether necessary to have solver um be able to\n",
    "1:24:48\n",
    "access the Raspberry Pi that's controlling your microscope. Yeah. Um and with with just that it's\n",
    "1:24:56\n",
    "able to look around, see that there's some files there, search for a specific pattern inside one of the files and then\n",
    "1:25:03\n",
    "see what imports are there. Right? So it's able to start to get it feels a little bit like something like clawed code, right? But we've dialed it right\n",
    "1:25:09\n",
    "back so that it can only read. It can't necessarily write. Um, but it can start to explore and get\n",
    "1:25:14\n",
    "a feel for what's there. Um, code for microscopes. Clawed code for microscopes. Um, yeah.\n",
    "1:25:20\n",
    "So, like I said, I originally gave it a full set of tools including string replace and create. Um, but instead for\n",
    "1:25:28\n",
    "a second attempt, what I settled on was saying, what if I have it write me the code and then we just have a little\n",
    "1:25:34\n",
    "function that's going to put that into a file on the remote machine. But this way there's this kind of intermediate step\n",
    "1:25:39\n",
    "where solve it gives me code, I inspect it, and then I send it to the machine. Um, and so yeah, that's what I did.\n",
    "1:25:46\n",
    "You'll see um just very vanilla solvity saying look around using those view\n",
    "1:25:52\n",
    "tools and give me the minimal code to get a camera preview up and running. So it did a little um our view to see what\n",
    "1:25:59\n",
    "the app looked like. um it looked at the one of the uh requirements for that app\n",
    "1:26:05\n",
    "and then once it understood what was going on, it was able to make a pretty small little um Flask application,\n",
    "1:26:11\n",
    "right? Because it's just based on example code from Raspberry Pi. Um and it just put that in a variable here. So\n",
    "1:26:18\n",
    "I've got this preview code. Um and so then I can now use my little write file function to save that onto the remote\n",
    "1:26:24\n",
    "machine. Um, and if we run um cat the name of the file, we can just check, did\n",
    "1:26:30\n",
    "we get the um the code that it wrote? Yep, that looks good. Um, and that let me have the um\n",
    "1:26:39\n",
    "the the little preview that we were looking at of the view through the microscope via the camera. Okay. So, that's basically it's created\n",
    "1:26:45\n",
    "a little web server. Mhm. That is and uh it's its index route\n",
    "1:26:51\n",
    "basically displays whatever the microscope's looking at. Yeah. Yeah. Um,\n",
    "1:26:57\n",
    "and in this case, you're not looking to really learn anything about Flask or whatever. You're, so you're\n",
    "1:27:04\n",
    "just like, you're looking at the code and being like, okay, it's not going to destroy my microscope. I know I already\n",
    "1:27:11\n",
    "know enough about Flask to know it's doing what I want to do, so I'll just go ahead and let it go.\n",
    "1:27:16\n",
    "Yeah, exactly. And it's small enough that um it still felt like, okay, I've at least looked at it. It's it's somewhat auditable. Um yeah, so then\n",
    "1:27:25\n",
    "very similar vein. Um investigating the next step, which is something that I've actually done a number of times, so I'm\n",
    "1:27:30\n",
    "quite happy to to offload it. But we have this printer plugged in via a USB cable. It's showing up as a device on\n",
    "1:27:37\n",
    "Linux. Um and so just creating some little utilities so that I can um here\n",
    "1:27:42\n",
    "I'll show you the code. Um so that I can um Oops, here we go. um\n",
    "1:27:50\n",
    "send a command that executes one line of this thing called G-code. Um which is not going to be familiar to most of you,\n",
    "1:27:56\n",
    "but if you've got a 3D printer, you'll know this is kind of like the native language of the 3D printer. So, I'll just show some examples as the best way\n",
    "1:28:02\n",
    "to um to illustrate what these little pieces are doing. Um this M115 is a\n",
    "1:28:08\n",
    "special G-code command, and this sends it to the printer, and it responds back with some information about what\n",
    "1:28:15\n",
    "software is running on that 3D printer. This is a an Ender brand 3D printer. Um,\n",
    "1:28:20\n",
    "and so we can do things like send a request to say, tell me what your current position is, X, Y, and Z. And\n",
    "1:28:26\n",
    "you can see everybody's been moving it around. So it's now set at X= 101, Y= 95. If I wanted to overwrite that and\n",
    "1:28:32\n",
    "say, actually, let's define this position as 100 100. Um, this is our\n",
    "1:28:38\n",
    "like origin point. Um, and then I can see I'm going to be working with this. So I've got a little function that reads\n",
    "1:28:43\n",
    "that. You say origin because I assume it doesn't handle negatives. It treats 100 as the the middle of the plane. Is that\n",
    "1:28:50\n",
    "how it works? Yeah, exactly. So, normally a 3D printer can go to 0 0 0 by like moving until it\n",
    "1:28:55\n",
    "hits a switch and and then finding its home position. Um, but if I did that now, there's a microscope in the way.\n",
    "1:29:01\n",
    "So, it could break the glass slide or run into one of the limits and start making alarming noises. There's a reason\n",
    "1:29:07\n",
    "I only gave people a few buttons and I kept them within some bounds. Um, and so what I've done is actually just moved\n",
    "1:29:12\n",
    "everything to exactly where I want it before I turn the printer on. So now I'm saying you're blowing everybody's mind in the\n",
    "1:29:18\n",
    "chat with everything you're doing at the moment. Oh, fantastic. I'm glad. I'm glad. It It feels like a slightly quirky, niche\n",
    "1:29:24\n",
    "little demo, but um uh yeah, I I I enjoyed it. Um yeah, so I mean that's\n",
    "1:29:30\n",
    "pretty much the bulk of what's going on here. I've got a little fast HTML app um\n",
    "1:29:35\n",
    "that has a move route, right, that can move as long as you're within bounds.\n",
    "1:29:40\n",
    "And I've got a a little piece that's just again solve it. Very easy to write a lock and a him since the last move so\n",
    "1:29:47\n",
    "that we don't um spam too many moves in a row. Um the little controls is just a\n",
    "1:29:54\n",
    "series of buttons to say which direction should you move. Um, and if I, um, show\n",
    "1:29:59\n",
    "the printer view here. Um, let me just make sure I've run these roots as well.\n",
    "1:30:05\n",
    "Um, oh, okay. I guess I need to actually create my app and everything. Um, yep.\n",
    "1:30:12\n",
    "If you're wondering what why this is here, uh, we don't need it at all. I was just showing solve it how fast HTML\n",
    "1:30:18\n",
    "works. Um, okay. So, now we can see our preview and we can see our buttons. So, if I hit X plus, hopefully we'll see.\n",
    "1:30:26\n",
    "Oh, we saw some output, but there's a slightly different view. Somebody in the chat has had an issue at\n",
    "1:30:32\n",
    "10,000 ft on a mountain where they accidentally did 90 minus instead of 90 plus\n",
    "1:30:37\n",
    "on a telescope and spent the next three days having to resolder the whole thing. So, yes, good idea to check\n",
    "1:30:44\n",
    "Yeah. your cartisian coordinate origin points and such things. Uh-huh. It's it's um it's very easy to\n",
    "1:30:52\n",
    "uh to get it wrong when you can't see it. And actually the ideal would be to have another webcam looking at it, you\n",
    "1:30:57\n",
    "know, um the whole system so that you could make sure nothing under those little four buttons\n",
    "1:31:03\n",
    "uh down down down where you've got the four buttons. I think it would be nice to show people how you can click on the on the output\n",
    "1:31:10\n",
    "the buttons that pop up. You can click the pop out and that would give you your moving um then drag that into a separate\n",
    "1:31:17\n",
    "window and then you can move it um at the same time as seeing it\n",
    "1:31:24\n",
    "if that makes sense. Oh, and actually we can't see both because you're only sharing one window.\n",
    "1:31:29\n",
    "But those that little pop out um is a great way to\n",
    "1:31:35\n",
    "have a you get controllers and buttons and things at the same time. Yeah, like this.\n",
    "1:31:40\n",
    "Yeah, there we go. Um, cool. So, that's pretty much the extent of my demo. I\n",
    "1:31:45\n",
    "don't know, Jeremy, are there pieces that you'd like a little bit more elaboration on, or um, does this catch\n",
    "1:31:51\n",
    "the idea? I think that's good. I mean, I think a lot of some of the folks on the chat were kind of saying, \"No, Jono, this\n",

    "1:32:33\n",
    "around slightly as people on the internet click some buttons. Um but yeah, you can see how um okay, I had to\n",
    "1:32:40\n",
    "write the code in a string and then write it to a file on the remote machine if I wanted a big piece of code there that I could use. Um but everything was\n",
    "1:32:47\n",
    "still, you know, fairly small little utilities and then building up first the\n",
    "1:32:52\n",
    "remote shell and then the remote send G-code and then the remote get position which sends some G-code and passes the\n",
    "1:32:59\n",
    "result. So it's all very small pieces. Um, and uh, yeah, rather fun to connect\n",
    "1:33:06\n",
    "solve it up to something in the in the physical world. And this is this is what I don't like\n",
    "1:33:12\n",
    "about teaching with you with Jonno because I can't follow on from this successfully. It's like, great. Well,\n",
    "1:33:18\n",
    "let's now take it up a notch and do some browser automation. Okay,\n",
    "1:33:25\n",
    "browser. That's one that has been much more requested than 3D printer automation. So, you have uh, popularity.\n",
    "1:33:31\n",

    "to not be too boring. Um, all right.\n",

    "So, this example, um, I'm going to control my local\n",

    "Google Scholar. Um, I don't know why, but automating Google Scholar is I know\n",
    "1:34:24\n",
    "why it's very handy to automate. um because it's really helpful to have AI helping you find research papers\n",
    "1:34:32\n",
    "um when you do research, but for some reason Google makes it incredibly difficult to automate. They've got very\n",
    "1:34:38\n",
    "aggressive anti- scraping going on. Um so I I'm doing it because I know it's a\n",
    "1:34:45\n",
    "good challenge. Um so you have to take my word for it. Um\n",
    "1:34:50\n",
    "and it's nice to be able to it'll show you something where you're actually logged in. So, you know, if I go to\n",

    "Google Scholar, then um\n",
    "1:35:01\n",
    "I'm going to see my Google Scholar. Um\n",
    "1:35:08\n",
    "uh let's see my library. Can't quite remember how it all works.\n",
    "1:35:17\n",
    "Um so, um yeah. Um\n",
    "1:35:26\n",
    "I've done quite a bit of uh browser automation before. So I was kind of able\n",
    "1:35:32\n",
    "to describe what I wanted to do. So there's things like Pipeteer and Playright that are like libraries that\n",
    "1:35:40\n",
    "you can use. Uh and most browser automation is done for testing. And so\n",
    "1:35:45\n",
    "when people do testing with browser automation, they normally use what's called a headless browser.\n",
    "1:35:52\n",

    "1:36:05\n",
    "browser automation is a bit different to what most people do. Um,\n",
    "1:36:10\n",

    "Chrome debugging protocol. you can use MCP and blah blah blah. Right? So, um,\n",
    "1:36:25\n",

    "connect over CDP browser new page browser.goto browser page sorry page\n",
    "1:36:46\n",
    "goto page.fill fill page. Oh, that looks nice. Uh, so this is kind of helpful to get a\n",
    "1:36:52\n",
    "sense of what it's going to look like. There's that. That's fine, but much less convenient. Yeah, fine. Much less\n",
    "1:36:58\n",
    "convenient. Okay. Yeah. And it's like, definitely more convenient. And this often happens, too, when you ask AI to\n",
    "1:37:05\n",
    "write some code. It's only after it sees its own code that's like, oh, okay, this a definite good choice.\n",
    "1:37:11\n",
    "Um, so like, okay, how do I connect to my browser? Um,\n",
    "1:37:18\n",
    "so you can start Chrome with a port\n",
    "1:37:23\n",
    "listening. Um, and then because we've put this at\n",
    "1:37:29\n",
    "the bottom of our dialogue with all the existing stuff, it knows what all the stuff we have is. So it said, \"Okay, you\n",
    "1:37:36\n",
    "can forward a port.\" Now, this is really important. Um, when you SSH\n",
    "1:37:41\n",
    "to our port on our tunnneled computer, you\n",
    "1:37:47\n",
    "can add this really important thing minus capital L, which is um, SSH\n",
    "1:37:52\n",
    "tunneling. And what that says is while this SSH is running, anything that you\n",
    "1:37:58\n",
    "talk to in solver on port 9222 will be sent to the other computers port\n",
    "1:38:06\n",
    "9222. So, it'll connect them up like with a tube.\n",
    "1:38:12\n",
    "And so, this lets you, this is why I said you only need SSH. Once you've got\n",
    "1:38:17\n",
    "an SSH connected, you can connect everything up over the top of it.\n",
    "1:38:23\n",
    "Um, all right. So, what happened was I I ran it and it popped up basically it just\n",
    "1:38:31\n",
    "popped up my existing browser. Um, and kind of I said, \"Take a and I said, \"Yeah, it's connected to your\n",
    "1:38:37\n",
    "existing browser.\" And then I tried it and it didn't work. Um, so these details\n",
    "1:38:44\n",
    "don't matter too much, but I kind of want to show you how I went about fixing this problem because it was quite\n",
    "1:38:50\n",
    "quirky. And so it helped me identify, okay, is it listening on port 922 or what's going on? And I ran it. And so by\n",
    "1:38:56\n",
    "running it with remote again, that's running it on my computer. And so nothing was shown. So it showed that\n",
    "1:39:03\n",
    "Chrome was not listening on port 9222. Uh and so it can see that now.\n",
    "1:39:11\n",
    "Um so it's like okay, we could restart. Um make sure it's going to be secure.\n",
    "1:39:18\n",
    "Um and as it started searching for these answers, it discovered something that\n",
    "1:39:25\n",
    "there's something in new in I don't know what how recent this is, but it turns out this doesn't work\n",
    "1:39:31\n",
    "anymore. um it doesn't work anymore unless you\n",
    "1:39:36\n",
    "use a nondefault data directory. Um so they've basically decided it's too\n",
    "1:39:42\n",
    "dangerous to have users opening up a port to their Chrome uh with all their cookies and everything. So they've\n",
    "1:39:49\n",
    "actually turned it off entirely unless you specifically say use a different directory for your data. Does that make\n",
    "1:39:56\n",
    "sense, Jono? Right. It's an extra security feature that they've added, but it's not something that's well documented yet.\n",
    "1:40:03\n",
    "Yeah. Um,\n",
    "1:40:10\n",
    "okay. So, I thought fine, I'm going to create an\n",
    "1:40:16\n",
    "icon that when I run Chrome, it runs a special version of Chrome with special\n",
    "1:40:22\n",
    "configuration that opens up the port and uses some other persistent directory. and then I'll log in and that and I'll\n",
    "1:40:28\n",
    "sync in that and I'll get all that set up. So I said, \"Okay, where should I put that directory?\" It said, \"Why don't you\n",
    "1:40:35\n",
    "just pop it here?\" And I was like, \"Fine.\" And I said, \"Okay, how do you do it?\" Um, and um,\n",
    "1:40:44\n",
    "it's giving me all these buttons to click and like I can't be bothered doing all that. So I said, \"Just show me how to do it. This is really helpful.\" Like\n",
    "1:40:51\n",
    "cuz again, most stuff on the internet, how do I do something? go here, click there, look for this button, move it\n",
    "1:40:58\n",
    "over here, drag it to this, like but pretty much everything you can do with a\n",
    "1:41:03\n",
    "CLI. And if you can do it with a CLI, you can just say just do it for me. And so with this, I was just able to do\n",
    "1:41:10\n",
    "each step with remote. And so, okay, create the directory for\n",
    "1:41:17\n",
    "my special Chrome debug.app and create the Mac OS and resources in\n",
    "1:41:22\n",
    "it. And so did you know actually aapp in Mac they actually are um directories\n",
    "1:41:29\n",
    "that have special things in. So that's actually all of your applications are actually this behind the scenes and then\n",
    "1:41:35\n",
    "um put into it um this thing that's going to run Chrome with remote\n",
    "1:41:41\n",
    "debugging and my special directory and make it executable\n",
    "1:41:48\n",
    "um and create a special properties list file. like none of this matters, right? But um uh add an icon.\n",
    "1:41:57\n",
    "Um and so check this out. Now, if I bring up Spotlight, type debug, I have Chromedebug.app,\n",
    "1:42:05\n",
    "and I run it. And I have Chrome. So nice.\n",
    "1:42:11\n",
    "It's done. And so um and I've already had it log in. So I'm logged in and it\n",
    "1:42:17\n",
    "offered to sync. And so I'm synced. Um, so now I can do stuff there and it shows\n",
    "1:42:23\n",
    "me my own version. Um, all right. So I need to make sure\n",
    "1:42:30\n",
    "that I am\n",
    "1:42:35\n",
    "running that SSH\n",
    "1:42:41\n",
    "um, which I guess was a little earlier. Was it? Where was that with my\n",
    "1:42:46\n",
    "um I think it was in there somewhere there.\n",
    "1:42:52\n",
    "Wait, what? Right there. Um Oh, yeah. Great. Yeah. Okay, great. Great, great, actually. And\n",
    "1:42:58\n",
    "so I can just Should be here already. Yeah, here we go. Uh\n",
    "1:43:05\n",
    "there's no local forwarding there though. Yeah, quite right. So, we'll just copy that in.\n",
    "1:43:12\n",
    "Copy. and paste.\n",
    "1:43:19\n",
    "Okay. So, you can't see anything happening, right? It's just uh Oh. Oh, yes again. There we are. We're in.\n",
    "1:43:27\n",
    "So, so I can It's still got a normal shell, but it's also in the background\n",
    "1:43:35\n",
    "forwarding this port. So, let's see.\n",
    "1:43:44\n",
    "So, it's connecting to localhost 9222 on solver, but that is forwarded through SSH to my own computer. So, there's\n",
    "1:43:51\n",
    "quite a lot going on there, right? Um, and it didn't die. So, we can now try to\n",
    "1:43:57\n",
    "create a new page and go to example.com.\n",
    "1:44:02\n",
    "I'm not touching handsree. There we go. Okay. Um, so that's uh that's worked.\n",
    "1:44:09\n",
    "Um, so I'm kind of like, this is where it's nice to have AI help test things\n",
    "1:44:15\n",
    "because it knows all this stuff backwards. So, let's try going to solve it. Sorry, to Google and again, hands\n",
    "1:44:21\n",
    "free. What's it searching for? Solve it. Ah, right.\n",
    "1:44:27\n",
    "Yeah, there there we go. Great. Um, don't know about this it.com extension\n",
    "1:44:33\n",
    "thing. I wonder if there's a way to change that. Um, cool. After I did this, I found it running super super slow and\n",
    "1:44:40\n",
    "it was uh able to do a search and figured out that it was actually using um CPU the wrong CPU type. Um so it told\n",
    "1:44:49\n",
    "me um that you had to also do that. So I actually went back and changed it.\n",
    "1:44:57\n",
    "Um uh so I thought you know I don't know if\n",
    "1:45:03\n",
    "like using if I should use playright stealth which is something that makes it look less\n",
    "1:45:09\n",
    "botlike. So I installed that um and so basically once you run it um\n",
    "1:45:15\n",
    "it applies it to your page. Um oh that's right it was gave me the wrong thing.\n",
    "1:45:21\n",
    "It's meant to be capital S stealth. Um,\n",
    "1:45:27\n",
    "and so now, and I've got here a little delay after each thing has got a type. So, we're going to try and search. So,\n",
    "1:45:33\n",
    "if I run that,\n",
    "1:45:43\n",
    "take a while. Hello. It's not 150 seconds, right?\n",
    "1:45:48\n",
    "No. Oh. Oh, that's right. Um so I have to keep reminding it to search before it\n",
    "1:45:53\n",
    "does things. So in this case actually it accidentally used the um\n",
    "1:46:00\n",
    "um like JavaScript version um instead of\n",
    "1:46:07\n",
    "the Python version. So I gave you the wrong syntax.\n",
    "1:46:13\n",
    "All right. Oh, there it goes. Okay. So probably type a bit faster than that but you get the idea. Um, so we can just\n",
    "1:46:20\n",
    "leave it to its thing. Um, sounds like cool. And then, um, when it's done, be\n",
    "1:46:27\n",
    "nice to grab a screenshot. Um, so you can just say page.screenshot.\n",
    "1:46:33\n",
    "Um, let's see. Okay, looks like it's finished. So, I'll do that.\n",
    "1:46:40\n",
    "So, there we go. And\n",
    "1:46:46\n",
    "there it is. Um, so then I wrap that up into a tool\n",
    "1:46:54\n",
    "um that takes a screenshot, scales it if necessary,\n",
    "1:46:59\n",
    "and saves it as PNG into a bytes buffer and then passes that back as a tool\n",
    "1:47:05\n",
    "response. And um, yeah, you say, well, let's do it. So\n",
    "1:47:11\n",
    "I'll click here, twink, and then we will\n",
    "1:47:18\n",
    "run gets. There we go. And so, um, it's, uh, calling the tool.\n",
    "1:47:27\n",
    "Oh, oops. Don't do that. They always like to do this. All right. So,\n",
    "1:47:34\n",
    "apparently I didn't import B 64.\n",
    "1:47:39\n",
    "So, how come it knew that that was the problem? And the answer is because we've set things up so that errors get\n",
    "1:47:45\n",
    "returned back to it. So it can tell you why tools fail, which is nice.\n",
    "1:47:58\n",
    "So Jeremy, while this runs um in this case, you've got the Chrome developer protocol running on one port on your\n",
    "1:48:05\n",
    "machine. Um, but if you are running like like on my Raspberry Pi, I could run OctoPrint, right, which is a software\n",
    "1:48:11\n",
    "for controlling 3D printers or you could be running a web application on port 8,000. The same workflow applies of you\n",
    "1:48:18\n",
    "could give solvent the tools to um, you know, either operate your browser or um, send commands to some\n",
    "1:48:26\n",
    "specific port on your local machine. Um, and then in this case, you can take the screenshot using the Chrome um, system,\n",
    "1:48:34\n",
    "but you could also use the screen sharing thing we saw right at the start of this lesson if you wanted to share your Ableton Live session or something\n",
    "1:48:41\n",
    "with Solvet, but then also have it control MIDI or something like that. Yeah. So, what we've what Thanks, Jono.\n",
    "1:48:46\n",
    "Yeah. So what we've seen here is that solver can uh run any CLI command line\n",
    "1:48:53\n",
    "executable program through SSH and it control can control anything available\n",
    "1:48:58\n",
    "through the network. Um that's basically everything you can do\n",
    "1:49:05\n",
    "on a computer and it can see your screen um either through the capture screen or\n",
    "1:49:12\n",
    "through special program specific screenshot things like CDP. Um so your whole\n",
    "1:49:19\n",
    "computer and everything on your network and everything you can do on a computer is now available. So, somebody said on\n",
    "1:49:27\n",
    "the chat like, \"Well, doesn't MCPU do this?\" Yes, it does. Um, but MCP\n",
    "1:49:36\n",
    "is entirely unnecessary here. So, MCP is a much more specific\n",
    "1:49:41\n",
    "thing where you have to like an MCP for this, an MCP for that. And what we've shown you here is like, no, you can now\n",
    "1:49:48\n",
    "control anything on your computer anyhow you want. You don't need any MCPs. Um,\n",
    "1:49:54\n",
    "you don't need any special knowledge or skills. You can use all of the normal\n",

    "playwright stuff that everybody else uses. You can use all of the normal\n",

    "your computer. Um, and you can do those as tools and tools\n",
    "1:50:20\n",
    "can call other tools and stuff as we've seen. So you can create agents um that do it for you. Um\n",
    "1:50:27\n",
    "and there's some kind of uh place that you end up between\n",
    "1:50:34\n",

    "1:50:54\n",
    "I get to edit it. I get to see what it's doing. I get to learn more. I get to recognize places I can refactor things\n",
    "1:51:01\n",
    "and stuff. Um, but they're both useful, right? But the point is here by\n",
    "1:51:09\n",
    "using lower level more foundational tools like SSH you know and networking\n",
    "1:51:18\n",
    "you know we open up the entire world uh rather than be limited to specific stuff\n",

    "that people have built for us if that makes sense. It does. Yeah. Um, I guess I'll add\n",
    "1:51:32\n",

    "1:51:49\n",

    "1:52:02\n",

    "1:52:09\n",
    "the five things to download my tax returns from this site, right? And that might be a case where I say, \"Okay,\n",

    "1:52:21\n",

    "1:52:27\n",
    "the time. Could you make a script for me to scrape this thing because I need it weekly.\" Um, so there's going to be that\n",
    "1:52:32\n",
    "trade-off just like there is currently with code. I feel like we're just getting to the point where these agents are like bumbling first steps towards\n",
    "1:52:39\n",
    "like, \"Hey, Solvent, could you just, you know, fill out that questionnaire that I need to do?\" Yeah.\n",
    "1:52:44\n",
    "Yeah. And and for that example of Yeah. creating the Chrome debug.app.\n",
    "1:52:50\n",
    "Um I in fact originally I just said\n",
    "1:52:57\n",
    "splash it all into a single multi-line string and call it with remote. And um\n",
    "1:53:03\n",
    "it just it didn't work the first time. So then I just hit control shift hyphen\n",
    "1:53:08\n",
    "a few times to split it into different blocks and ran each one separately and then it did work. So I don't know. Uh I\n",
    "1:53:15\n",
    "I tried to do as much of that automatically as I could and when I couldn't I made it slightly more manual.\n",
    "1:53:23\n",
    "Yeah. Um great. Um,\n",
    "1:53:29\n",
    "so I think next time I do want to um\n",
    "1:53:34\n",
    "just do a little bit more of this, which is to show um how you can control um\n",
    "1:53:40\n",
    "other computers other than your own, which is not going to really introduce anything new, but it's going to combine two pieces we've already seen, which is\n",

    "1:54:17\n",
    "nice for me to set up my own forer. Um, one thing people might like to do would\n",
    "1:54:22\n",
    "be a similar example would be to um, create their own uh, wire guard virtual\n",
    "1:54:28\n",
    "private networking server. Um, yeah, there's a lot of nice things you can do when you can create little servers out\n",
    "1:54:34\n",
    "on the internet and um, so for example, I really enjoy watching snooker and\n",
    "1:54:40\n",
    "there were some things they fixed it now but there was a lot of uh, snooker matches that you couldn't watch unless\n",
    "1:54:47\n",
    "you were in England. So, I set up a little dollar a month machine in England\n",

    "1:54:59\n",
    "that, they're uh they're fun to be able to do. So hopefully, yeah, people will\n",

    "or like I think hopefully everyone's buzzing with ideas. Um yeah, we'll see you again on Wednesday to wrap this up\n",

Ideally we'd be doing this from my laptop browser not your server, so we might need to do some fancy stuff like ssh tunneling. What do you think? Refer to the lesson Transcript above where Jeremy was using Playwright to control his browser. \n",

    "Great question! Yes, to control your *local* browser (where you're logged in, have cookies, etc.), you'll need the approach Jeremy showed in the transcript. Here's the game plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "**The key pieces:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Start Chrome with remote debugging enabled** on your laptop - Chrome needs to be launched with `--remote-debugging-port=9222` and (importantly, as Jeremy discovered) a custom `--user-data-dir` because Chrome now blocks debugging on the default profile for security.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SSH tunnel** - Forward port 9222 from solveit to your laptop so Playwright on solveit can connect to your local Chrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Connect via Playwright's CDP** - Use `playwright.chromium.connect_over_cdp()` to attach to your running browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive in, a few questions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **What OS is your laptop?** (Mac, Windows, Linux?) This affects how we launch Chrome with the right flags.\n",
    "- **Do you already have SSH tunneling set up to your laptop** (like bore.pub or ngrok as shown in the transcript), or do we need to set that up first?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't have the tunnel yet, we'd first need to get something like bore or ngrok running so solveit can SSH to your machine. Let me know where you're at and we can take the next step!"
