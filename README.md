# formalyzer


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Description:

Formalyzer will scrape the text from the PDF recc letter, and for each
URL in url_list, it will:

- launch a browser tab for that url
- fill in the form using what the LLM has gleaned from the recc letter
- attach the PDF via the form’s upload/attachment button

…and do no more.

The user will need to review the page and press the Submit button
manually.

### Requirements:

- Playwright
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var. (Could support other LLMs layer)
- pdftotext

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

## Usage

On MacOS, startup the Chrome browser looking to port 9222 by executing
this command in the terminal:

``` bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-debug
```

Then you can run this command:

``` bash
./formalyzer.py --debug <recc_info.txt> <recc_letter.pdf> <url_list.txt>
```

where `recc_info.txt` contains information about the recommender, their
name, their title, their address, phone number and email.

I’ve run nbdev readme and and it generates, it tries to run a lot of not
exported code cells from my `nbs/00_core.ipynb` file. I don’t want that,
but I do want a new README file.
