# formalyzer


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Description:

Formalyzer will scrape the text from the PDF recc letter, and for each
URL in url_list, it will:

- launch a browser tab for that url
- fill in the form using what the LLM has gleaned from the recc letter
- attach the PDF via the form’s upload/attachment button

…and do no more.

The user will need to review the page and press the Submit button
manually.

### Requirements:

- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` environment variable set (Could support other LLMs
  later)
- `beautifulsoup4, playwright, claudette, pypdf, fastcore`

## Usage

On MacOS, startup the Chrome browser looking to port 9222 by executing
this command in the terminal:

``` bash
/Applications/Google\ Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google\ Chrome --remote-debugging-port=9222 --user-data-dir=/tmp/chrome-debug
```

Then you can run this command:

``` bash
formalyzer --debug <recc_info.txt> <recc_letter.pdf> <url_list.txt>
```

where `recc_info.txt` contains information about the recommender, their
name, their title, their address, phone number and email.
`urls_list.txt` is a file containing one URL per line.

## TODO:

- Test with a less-than-superlative recc letter – to make sure it’s not
  just always selecting the top rating(s).
- Enable switching from Anthropic API to local LLM and/or CoPilot API
  (if possible)
