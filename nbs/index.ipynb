    "## Description\n",
    "Formalyzer will scrape the text from the PDF recc letter, \n",
    "and for each URL in url_list, it will: \n",
    "\n",
    "- launch a browser tab for that url \n",
    "- fill in the form using what the LLM has gleaned from the recc letter\n",
    "- attach the PDF via the form's upload/attachment button\n",

    "The user will need to review the page and press the Submit button manually.\n",

    "- `beautifulsoup4, playwright, claudette, lisette, pypdf, fastcore` \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Technical Approach\n",
    "You *could* try to feed raw HTML and PDF into an LLM, but that could be prohibitively slow\n",
    "and expensive.  Instead: \n",
    "- Use standard packages to pre-process & reduce the inputs: `bs4` for HTML, `pypdf` for PDF\n",
    "- Use the LLM *only* for *reading* the reduced input texts (+ a system prompt) and *outputting* values to assign to form fields.\n",
    "- Use another existing package (`playwright`) actually fill in those fiels."
