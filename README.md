# formalyzer


<!-- WARNING: THIS FILE WAS AUTOGENERATED! DO NOT EDIT! -->

## Description:

Formalyzer will scrape the text from the PDF recc letter, and for each
URL in url_list, it will:

- launch a browser tab for that url
- fill in the form using what the LLM has gleaned from the recc letter
- attach the PDF via the form’s upload/attachment button

…and do no more.

The user will need to review the page and press the Submit button
manually.

### Requirements:

- Playwright
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` env var. (Could support other LLMs layer)
- pdftotext

If you are new to using `nbdev` here are some useful pointers to get you
started.

## Usage
